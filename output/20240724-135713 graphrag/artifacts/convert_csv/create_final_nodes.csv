0,GRAPHRAG,"PRODUCT, TECHNOLOGY","GraphRAG (Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a sophisticated software tool developed by Microsoft Research, designed to enhance the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in reasoning about complex information, particularly within private datasets. It operates by extracting a knowledge graph from the input corpus, which is then augmented with community summaries and graph machine learning outputs to improve query responses. GraphRAG demonstrates a significant enhancement in answering intricate questions compared to other approaches.

The process involves indexing and slicing the input corpus into TextUnits, followed by entity and relationship extraction. Hierarchical clustering using the Leiden technique is applied to identify themes and semantic clusters, enabling a more effective global search. Summaries of each community are generated to provide a holistic understanding of the dataset, facilitating the summarization of themes in response to user queries.

GraphRAG is a structured, hierarchical approach to Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) that leverages the natural modularity of graphs to partition data for global summarization. It is distinct from other graph-based RAG systems by its ability to create domain adaptive templates for the generation of knowledge graphs. This feature improves the results of an Index Run by adapting to specific domains through the use of templates.

The tool requires an initialized workspace with the graphrag.index --init command to function properly. The initialization process creates necessary configuration files and default prompts. Users can customize the template generation algorithm by tweaking various parameters, allowing for greater flexibility and adaptability to different domains.

GraphRAG is a system for managing and processing graph-based data, offering features such as indexing, querying, and adapting prompts for better data handling.

0,COMMUNITY SUMMARIES,"DATA, OUTPUT","Community Summaries are a pivotal component within the GraphRAG framework, serving as a kind of self-memory for generation-augmented retrieval that facilitates future generation cycles. These summaries are pre-generated for groups of closely-related entities identified in the entity knowledge graph, designed to scale to very large datasets and independently useful for understanding the global structure and semantics of the dataset. They are created for each community in the Leiden hierarchy, allowing for answering questions at different hierarchical levels, which may offer varying balances of detail and scope for general sensemaking questions. The summaries are categorized into different levels (C0-C3), with C0 being the root-level summary and C3 the low-level summary, providing a more concise representation of the original content.

The summaries are prepared by shuffling and dividing them into chunks of pre-specified token size to ensure even distribution of relevant information. They are ranked based on the number of tokens they contain, and shorter summaries may replace longer ones to fit within the context window. The summaries are used to generate community answers, which are then combined into a global answer. The global answer is generated by mapping community answers, generating intermediate answers for each chunk, and reducing them to a single global answer. The intermediate answers are scored by an LLM on a scale of 0-100 based on their helpfulness in answering the target question, with answers scoring 0 being filtered out. The global answer is the final result of this process, making the community summaries a crucial element in the generation of a comprehensive and contextually relevant response to user queries.

For leaf-level communities, element summaries are added to the LLM context window until the token limit is reached. For higher-level communities, if all element summaries fit within the token limit, they are summarized as is; otherwise, sub-community summaries are substituted for their associated element summaries to fit within the context window. Community summaries are condensed versions of information or data, often created by or for a community, which can be used to provide an overview or key insights from a larger set of data or documents. They are generated for leaf-level and higher-level communities to provide an overview of the elements (nodes, edges, covariates) within a corpus, prioritized based on the prominence of the elements, and used to make sense of a corpus or to answer global queries.","369b39fdfd649d6df32a5d7b4cc559b7,7040ba36a7c09899a355d14a30d65375,71f14506a6b15dfabd93fd1606a67b73,7da3d8d244b67f09425a4a7783e4bb55,849698743b07680402ff8572b1c6c469,93d4d4effbf989e6ef1c4c3b4f42494e,9b52298451f8936974ab08a129b0b92e,a660289d2bf43f25d3524d35cd2d9a96,b149708d0b4ac3ff417565739ea6b03b,d08fc91bbfe9749abab38a99a1a88dc6,f76c18c7582167c3626f8741c2c9374f",6,13,43,32ee140946e5461f9275db664dc541a5,13,,,32ee140946e5461f9275db664dc541a5,0,0

It is particularly adept at providing detailed information about specific characters, themes, or relationships within the data, offering a more targeted approach to data exploration.

Local Search enables reasoning about specific entities by exploring their immediate neighbors and associated concepts in a graph or network. It uses a context builder class to generate context for the search and can be enhanced with various parameters such as llm_params and context_builder_params. This method is suitable for questions that require an understanding of specific entities mentioned in the documents, as it can extract and prioritize relevant structured and unstructured data, including entities, relationships, and other data records, which are then used to generate context for question generation.

However, Local Search is limited in its ability to aggregate information across the entire dataset, focusing instead on finding information that is semantically similar to a query within a specific context.

1,GRAPHRAG,"PRODUCT, TECHNOLOGY","GraphRAG (Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a sophisticated software tool developed by Microsoft Research, designed to enhance the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in reasoning about complex information, particularly within private datasets. It operates by extracting a knowledge graph from the input corpus, which is then augmented with community summaries and graph machine learning outputs to improve query responses. GraphRAG demonstrates a significant enhancement in answering intricate questions compared to other approaches.

The process involves indexing and slicing the input corpus into TextUnits, followed by entity and relationship extraction. Hierarchical clustering using the Leiden technique is applied to identify themes and semantic clusters, enabling a more effective global search. Summaries of each community are generated to provide a holistic understanding of the dataset, facilitating the summarization of themes in response to user queries.

GraphRAG is a structured, hierarchical approach to Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) that leverages the natural modularity of graphs to partition data for global summarization. It is distinct from other graph-based RAG systems by its ability to create domain adaptive templates for the generation of knowledge graphs. This feature improves the results of an Index Run by adapting to specific domains through the use of templates.

The tool requires an initialized workspace with the graphrag.index --init command to function properly. The initialization process creates necessary configuration files and default prompts. Users can customize the template generation algorithm by tweaking various parameters, allowing for greater flexibility and adaptability to different domains.

1,COMMUNITY SUMMARIES,"DATA, OUTPUT","Community Summaries are a pivotal component within the GraphRAG framework, serving as a kind of self-memory for generation-augmented retrieval that facilitates future generation cycles. These summaries are pre-generated for groups of closely-related entities identified in the entity knowledge graph, designed to scale to very large datasets and independently useful for understanding the global structure and semantics of the dataset. They are created for each community in the Leiden hierarchy, allowing for answering questions at different hierarchical levels, which may offer varying balances of detail and scope for general sensemaking questions. The summaries are categorized into different levels (C0-C3), with C0 being the root-level summary and C3 the low-level summary, providing a more concise representation of the original content.

The summaries are prepared by shuffling and dividing them into chunks of pre-specified token size to ensure even distribution of relevant information. They are ranked based on the number of tokens they contain, and shorter summaries may replace longer ones to fit within the context window. The summaries are used to generate community answers, which are then combined into a global answer. The global answer is generated by mapping community answers, generating intermediate answers for each chunk, and reducing them to a single global answer. The intermediate answers are scored by an LLM on a scale of 0-100 based on their helpfulness in answering the target question, with answers scoring 0 being filtered out. The global answer is the final result of this process, making the community summaries a crucial element in the generation of a comprehensive and contextually relevant response to user queries.

For leaf-level communities, element summaries are added to the LLM context window until the token limit is reached. For higher-level communities, if all element summaries fit within the token limit, they are summarized as is; otherwise, sub-community summaries are substituted for their associated element summaries to fit within the context window. Community summaries are condensed versions of information or data, often created by or for a community, which can be used to provide an overview or key insights from a larger set of data or documents. They are generated for leaf-level and higher-level communities to provide an overview of the elements (nodes, edges, covariates) within a corpus, prioritized based on the prominence of the elements, and used to make sense of a corpus or to answer global queries.","369b39fdfd649d6df32a5d7b4cc559b7,7040ba36a7c09899a355d14a30d65375,71f14506a6b15dfabd93fd1606a67b73,7da3d8d244b67f09425a4a7783e4bb55,849698743b07680402ff8572b1c6c469,93d4d4effbf989e6ef1c4c3b4f42494e,9b52298451f8936974ab08a129b0b92e,a660289d2bf43f25d3524d35cd2d9a96,b149708d0b4ac3ff417565739ea6b03b,d08fc91bbfe9749abab38a99a1a88dc6,f76c18c7582167c3626f8741c2c9374f",49,13,43,32ee140946e5461f9275db664dc541a5,13,,,32ee140946e5461f9275db664dc541a5,0,0
1,GLOBAL SEARCH,"FUNCTION, QUERY MODE","Global Search is a comprehensive query method designed to answer complex, high-level questions about a dataset by aggregating information across the entire dataset.

Global Search is particularly useful after the Indexer has processed the data, as it allows for the exploration of the dataset's overall content and structure. In the context of the GraphRAG process, Global Search serves as a query mode that facilitates reasoning about holistic questions concerning the corpus by utilizing community summaries. The Query Engine employs Global Search to generate answers by searching over all AI-generated community reports in a map-reduce fashion, which, although resource-intensive, often yields high-quality responses for questions that require an understanding of the dataset as a whole.","369b39fdfd649d6df32a5d7b4cc559b7,3e143a60e2aeb57eb418a68d1484bbb3,ae6e91a8cc5773dbd4789773c9ef5a30,f8cf53ce98a8bc52581f7907ad98ef70",25,5,44,c160b9cb27d6408ba6ab20214a2f3f81,5,,,c160b9cb27d6408ba6ab20214a2f3f81,0,0
1,LOCAL SEARCH,"FUNCTION, QUERY MODE","Local Search is a sophisticated method employed in the GraphRAG process and the Query Engine, designed to answer specific questions about particular aspects or entities within a dataset. This technique combines structured data from the knowledge graph with unstructured data from input documents to augment the context of a language model with relevant entity information at query time. It is particularly adept at providing detailed information about specific characters, themes, or relationships within the data, offering a more targeted approach to data exploration.

Local Search enables reasoning about specific entities by exploring their immediate neighbors and associated concepts in a graph or network. It uses a context builder class to generate context for the search and can be enhanced with various parameters such as llm_params and context_builder_params. This method is suitable for questions that require an understanding of specific entities mentioned in the documents, as it can extract and prioritize relevant structured and unstructured data, including entities, relationships, and other data records, which are then used to generate context for question generation.

However, Local Search is limited in its ability to aggregate information across the entire dataset, focusing instead on finding information that is semantically similar to a query within a specific context. By fanning out to the neighbors and associated concepts of a particular entity, Local Search offers a powerful tool for data exploration and question answering in specialized professional networks and beyond.","1415949832ba3fee570ea961998a8ac4,364624242a84e1859e758069d914d8c8,369b39fdfd649d6df32a5d7b4cc559b7,3e143a60e2aeb57eb418a68d1484bbb3,849698743b07680402ff8572b1c6c469,ae6e91a8cc5773dbd4789773c9ef5a30,f8cf53ce98a8bc52581f7907ad98ef70",25,7,45,23527cd679ff4d5a988d52e7cd056078,7,,,23527cd679ff4d5a988d52e7cd056078,0,0

The process entails loading inputs, dividing them into text units, and executing a series of Large Language Model (LLM) invocations and template substitutions to generate refined prompts. Users are provided with default values by the system for ease of use, but the real power of Prompt Tuning lies in its ability to fine-tune these prompts according to the guidelines detailed in the GraphRAG documentation. By specifying a custom prompt file in plaintext and employing token replacements, users can tailor the prompts to their specific use cases, thereby boosting the effectiveness of knowledge discovery and natural language processing tasks. This customization ensures that the models perform optimally in the context of graph-based reasoning, making Prompt Tuning an essential tool for achieving the best possible results in knowledge graph creation.","369b39fdfd649d6df32a5d7b4cc559b7,4f37c0e9c3c9bac4e5c1c6821eea442e,6a7157695d90d434b2625c3f05420916,849698743b07680402ff8572b1c6c469,bdb8f9e797229f596744d9636ab857b0",18,8,46,f1c6eed066f24cbdb376b910fce29ed4,8,,,f1c6eed066f24cbdb376b910fce29ed4,0,0

2,COMMUNITY SUMMARIES,"DATA, OUTPUT","Community Summaries are a pivotal component within the GraphRAG framework, serving as a kind of self-memory for generation-augmented retrieval that facilitates future generation cycles. These summaries are pre-generated for groups of closely-related entities identified in the entity knowledge graph, designed to scale to very large datasets and independently useful for understanding the global structure and semantics of the dataset. They are created for each community in the Leiden hierarchy, allowing for answering questions at different hierarchical levels, which may offer varying balances of detail and scope for general sensemaking questions. The summaries are categorized into different levels (C0-C3), with C0 being the root-level summary and C3 the low-level summary, providing a more concise representation of the original content.

The summaries are prepared by shuffling and dividing them into chunks of pre-specified token size to ensure even distribution of relevant information. They are ranked based on the number of tokens they contain, and shorter summaries may replace longer ones to fit within the context window. The summaries are used to generate community answers, which are then combined into a global answer. The global answer is generated by mapping community answers, generating intermediate answers for each chunk, and reducing them to a single global answer. The intermediate answers are scored by an LLM on a scale of 0-100 based on their helpfulness in answering the target question, with answers scoring 0 being filtered out. The global answer is the final result of this process, making the community summaries a crucial element in the generation of a comprehensive and contextually relevant response to user queries.

For leaf-level communities, element summaries are added to the LLM context window until the token limit is reached. For higher-level communities, if all element summaries fit within the token limit, they are summarized as is; otherwise, sub-community summaries are substituted for their associated element summaries to fit within the context window. Community summaries are condensed versions of information or data, often created by or for a community, which can be used to provide an overview or key insights from a larger set of data or documents. They are generated for leaf-level and higher-level communities to provide an overview of the elements (nodes, edges, covariates) within a corpus, prioritized based on the prominence of the elements, and used to make sense of a corpus or to answer global queries.","369b39fdfd649d6df32a5d7b4cc559b7,7040ba36a7c09899a355d14a30d65375,71f14506a6b15dfabd93fd1606a67b73,7da3d8d244b67f09425a4a7783e4bb55,849698743b07680402ff8572b1c6c469,93d4d4effbf989e6ef1c4c3b4f42494e,9b52298451f8936974ab08a129b0b92e,a660289d2bf43f25d3524d35cd2d9a96,b149708d0b4ac3ff417565739ea6b03b,d08fc91bbfe9749abab38a99a1a88dc6,f76c18c7582167c3626f8741c2c9374f",,13,43,32ee140946e5461f9275db664dc541a5,13,,,32ee140946e5461f9275db664dc541a5,0,0
