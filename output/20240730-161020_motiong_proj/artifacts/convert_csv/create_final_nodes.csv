0,滤波器,"EQUIPMENT, COMPONENT","The entity known as ""滤波器"" (Lubōqì), often translated as ""Filter"" in English, serves dual critical functions within the realms of semiconductor manufacturing and electronic circuit design. In the context of semiconductor wafer handling equipment, the 滤波器 acts as a vital component designed to mitigate vibrations. These vibrations, often a result of mechanical differences within the machinery, can potentially harm the delicate process of wafer fabrication. By dampening these vibrations, the 滤波器 ensures a stable environment for the precise operations required in semiconductor production.

Simultaneously, in electronic circuits, the 滤波器 takes on a different but equally important role. It functions as a device that filters out unwanted frequencies or signals, ensuring that only the desired signals pass through. This capability is crucial for maintaining signal integrity and preventing interference, which could otherwise disrupt the performance of electronic devices.

In both applications, the 滤波器 demonstrates its versatility and importance in maintaining the efficiency and reliability of systems within the Manufacturing and Logistics Technology sector. Its presence in semiconductor wafer handling equipment highlights its role in the physical stability of manufacturing processes, while its function in electronic circuits underscores its contribution to signal clarity and system performance.","0987d36a491c685a7886b2fd0588769b,5f8661df37baa3fb7886ac845c1b589a",,2,637,74d43d20f251441baf8e3db64fedca43,2,,74d43d20f251441baf8e3db64fedca43,0,0

1,滤波器,"EQUIPMENT, COMPONENT","The entity known as ""滤波器"" (Lubōqì), often translated as ""Filter"" in English, serves dual critical functions within the realms of semiconductor manufacturing and electronic circuit design. In the context of semiconductor wafer handling equipment, the 滤波器 acts as a vital component designed to mitigate vibrations. These vibrations, often a result of mechanical differences within the machinery, can potentially harm the delicate process of wafer fabrication. By dampening these vibrations, the 滤波器 ensures a stable environment for the precise operations required in semiconductor production.

Simultaneously, in electronic circuits, the 滤波器 takes on a different but equally important role. It functions as a device that filters out unwanted frequencies or signals, ensuring that only the desired signals pass through. This capability is crucial for maintaining signal integrity and preventing interference, which could otherwise disrupt the performance of electronic devices.

In both applications, the 滤波器 demonstrates its versatility and importance in maintaining the efficiency and reliability of systems within the Manufacturing and Logistics Technology sector. Its presence in semiconductor wafer handling equipment highlights its role in the physical stability of manufacturing processes, while its function in electronic circuits underscores its contribution to signal clarity and system performance.","0987d36a491c685a7886b2fd0588769b,5f8661df37baa3fb7886ac845c1b589a",,2,637,74d43d20f251441baf8e3db64fedca43,2,,74d43d20f251441baf8e3db64fedca43,0,0

These vibrations, often a result of mechanical differences within the machinery, can potentially harm the delicate process of wafer fabrication. By dampening these vibrations, the 滤波器 ensures a stable environment for the precise operations required in semiconductor production.

Simultaneously, in electronic circuits, the 滤波器 takes on a different but equally important role. It functions as a device that filters out unwanted frequencies or signals, ensuring that only the desired signals pass through. This capability is crucial for maintaining signal integrity and preventing interference, which could otherwise disrupt the performance of electronic devices.
