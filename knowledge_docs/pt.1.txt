In a quiet little town called Clear Water Bay, three distinctively different friends live: Li Ming, Zhang Li, and Wang Hao.
Li Ming, a compassionate high school teacher at OneTwoThree Elementary, is known for his patience and understanding, often serving as a confidante for his friends' troubles.
Zhang Li is a lively community event organizer, always brimming with energy; her enthusiasm and creativity often inspire those around her.
Wang Hao is a reserved librarian, whose extensive knowledge and wisdom earn him great respect among his peers.
