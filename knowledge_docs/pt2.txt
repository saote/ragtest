The relationship among the trio is very close, despite their varying interests and professions. Li Ming and Zhang Li bonded over their mutual involvement in community service, while Wang Hao and Li Ming have been close friends since they were roommates in college. Zhang Li frequently uses her resources and connections to help Wang Hao organize cultural events, and Wang Hao, in turn, recommends enlightening books to both Zhang Li and Li Ming through his wide reading.

In this small circle, each individual adds to the others’ lives in their unique way, nurturing a special bond of friendship. They often travel together, discuss a range of topics—from literature and philosophy to the simple joys of daily life—strengthening their support for one another when facing life's challenges, and moving forward together.
